All of these books are exceptional, for which I consider myself lucky to have read them and to be in the midst of friends who continue to provide a steady stream of recommendations. The ones that truly expanded my thinking at the time of reading are highlighted in blue.

1. __[The Elephant in the Brain: Hidden Motives in Everyday Life](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28820444-the-elephant-in-the-brain)__ by Kevin Simler &amp; Robin Hanson
    
    By far one of the most (almost depressingly) influential books I've read in a while. Operates at an extreme density of insights / reality-check moments on a spectrum of topics from everyday life -- art, charity, politics, education, religion, medicine, etc.  
    
    Chapters follow a simple framework -- begin with observations of usual human activities (going to school / voting in elections / taking medicines, etc.), then describe why people think they do what they do (to get educated / to elect effective leaders / to keep healthy, etc.), then point out obvious loopholes in how activities don't align with stated goals, and finally propose an alternative causal hidden motive that explains behavior better than the publicly stated one.  
    
    You might or might not like what's said, but the observations of lack of alignment between stated motives and behavior do help build an accurate world model.
